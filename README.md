- Use environment variables for all authentication
- Verify SSL/TLS settings for external connections
- Follow company security policies for data access

### JIRA Workflow
- Always use the JIRA.ps1 script for JIRA interactions
- Update tickets proactively with progress comments
- Transition tickets through workflows appropriately
- Document decisions and changes for future reference

### HubSpot CRM
- Use appropriate filters to limit data retrieval
- Be mindful of API rate limits with bulk operations
- Use `ExcludeAutoGenerated` flag to focus on manual deals
- Document custom queries and integrations

### Elastic Queries
- Be cautious with query operations on production data
- Use appropriate time ranges to avoid performance impact
- Verify index patterns before executing searches
- Document custom queries for future reference

## Development

### Code Reviews
All scripts should be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.

### Version Control
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Follow branch naming conventions
- Keep commits focused and atomic
